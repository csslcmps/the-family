# The Family
In this README, I will outline all the steps I took to bring The Family together. It is important for me to keep track of what I have already learned, even if it seems basic. I am new to using React and even more so to trying the Next.js framework, so any constructive criticism or comments are welcome. Feel free to reach out if you want to join the family and contribute to evolving this project for our communities.

I believe that understanding where we are and what has led us here is crucial for our individual selves. The Family is intended to be a place where you can view, save, and share memories, culture, and traditions with your loved ones. Celebrating your family and your journey through life. :) 

### Creation (step-by-step)

Step 1: Environment Setup
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install it from https://nodejs.org/. Verify if Node.js is installed correctly by running the command node -v and the command npm -v in your terminal. This will display the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

Step 2: Create a new Next.js project
Open the terminal and run the following command to create a new Next.js project:

`npx create-next-app@latest --ts`

This will create a new directory with your application name and set up a Next.js project with TypeScript support.

Step 3: Access the project directory
Navigate to the newly created project directory by running the following command:

`cd the-family`

Step 4: Run the development server
To start the development server and view the application in your browser, run the following command:

`npm run dev`
